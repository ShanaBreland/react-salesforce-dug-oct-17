# React in Salesforce

Presented to the New York Salesforce Developer User Group in October 2017. Feel free to log issues to this repo or reach out via [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/rogermitchell) if there are any questions, comments, etc.

## Prerequisites

1. Set up a new Salesforce Developer Edition org [here](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup), or use an existing DE org
1. Install Node and npm from [NodeJS.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
1. Install React Dev Tools for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/)
1. Install Requestly for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/requestly-redirect-url-mo/mdnleldcmiljblolnjhpnblkcekpdkpa?hl=en) or [Firefox](https://www.requestly.in/home/)

## Getting Started

Open up your Terminal of choice, `git clone` this repository to your local machine, and `cd` into the top level directory. This contains two directories: **start** and **finish**.

**start** contains the base set of files before we begin developing any of the application. This is meant to provide a slight advantage to avoid building out each of the config files required for the project.


**finish** contains the set of files that we built during the hands on workshop. If you are interested in peeking ahead, you may do that too!

### `start` here

- `cd start` to change directories
- `npm install` to install a set of dependent packages that are referenced in `package.json` 

### For those that skip ahead to `finish` first
